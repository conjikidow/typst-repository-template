This is a template repository for Typst projects.

## GitHub Actions Permissions Setup

To enable GitHub Actions to run properly in your repository, you need to adjust the default permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is especially important for **private repositories**.

Follow these steps to configure the permissions:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. On the left-hand menu, select **Actions/General**.
3. Under the **Workflow permissions** section, ensure the following options are selected:
   - **`Read and write permissions`**: This grants read and write access to the repository for all scopes.
   - **`Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`**: This allows GitHub Actions to create pull requests.
4. Save the changes.

These settings are **necessary only for private repositories**. For public repositories, this configuration is not required.

## CI Setup

The CI workflow compiles the main Typst source files.
You can specify their paths as a space-separated list in [`ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L11):

```yaml
env:
  TYPST_MAIN_FILES: 'main.typ another.typ'
```

## Pre-commit Hooks Setup

To enable pre-commit hooks in your repository, you need to install `pre-commit` by running the following command:

```console
uvx pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```

## Commit Message Linting with Commitizen

This template repository enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) in pre-commit hooks and CI, so your commit messages must follow that format.
You can maintain Conventional Commits manually, but automation tools such as Commitizen or git-cz can help.
Any tool is fine, but this repository uses [commitizen-tools/commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) for checks, so it is recommended.

Install Commitizen:

```console
uv tool install commitizen
```

Use Commitizen instead of `git commit`:

```console
cz commit
```

For more details, see [Commitizen documentation](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen).

## Version Bumping by Labels

This repository is configured to automatically bump the version when a pull request is merged with one of the following labels:

- `update::major`
- `update::minor`
- `update::patch`

Simply add one of these labels to your pull request before merging.
A new pull request for the version bump will be automatically created.

The version number is managed via the `.bumpversion.toml` file in the repository root.
If your project defines its version in specific files (e.g., `typst.toml`, etc.), you may need to add entries like the following to `.bumpversion.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.bumpversion.files]]
filename = "typst.toml"
search = 'version = "{current_version}"'
replace = 'version = "{new_version}"'
```
